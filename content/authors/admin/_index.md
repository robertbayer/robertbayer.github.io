My name is Robert Bayer and I am a Ph.D. student in the Resource-Aware Data Systems (RAD) group at the IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark.
My research focuses on unlocking power of machine learning on small, resource-constrained hardware. Specifically I focus on challenges in resource management, task colocation and performance analysis.
